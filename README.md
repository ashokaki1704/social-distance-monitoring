certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise GitHub repository description for your Social Distance Monitoring System Project using Python and machine learning:

Social Distance Monitor: Detecting Violations and Ensuring Safe Distancing

This open-source project leverages Python, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning to create an intelligent system that monitors social distancing in public spaces and workplaces. The system identifies individuals who violate safe distancing norms and highlights them with red bounding boxes. Conversely, when people maintain a safe distance, the system displays green bounding boxes.

Key Features:

Real-time detection of social distancing violations
Utilizes deep learning models for accurate person detection
Compatible with edge AI devices such as NVIDIA Jetson, Google Coral, and more
Provides actionable insights for maintaining a safe environment
Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and enhance this vital system to promote safety and well-being! ðŸŒŸ
